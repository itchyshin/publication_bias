## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


### S1.1.1 Representative Sample

To select the representative sample of meta-analysis publications, we first searched the Scopus database for papers with (“meta-analy\*” OR “metaanaly\*” OR “meta-regression”) in the title, abstract, or keywords (where the asterisk allows for any ending to the word, such as “meta-analyses” or “meta-analysis”), restricted the date to papers published after 2009, and restricted the ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) to journals classified as ‘Ecology’ and/or ‘Evolutionary Biology’ by the 2017 rankings of the ISI InCites Journal Citation Reports. On 25 March 2019 this search returned 1,668 papers from 134 journals.
